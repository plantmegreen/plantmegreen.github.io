In this video transcript, we will discuss the best fertilizers for fig trees to ensure maximum fruit production. Timing and the right method are crucial when it comes to fertilizing fig trees, and following the steps outlined here can dramatically increase your fig harvest. So let’s dive in and learn how to optimize the fertilizing process for your fig trees.\nUnderstanding the Transition Phase\nBefore we dive into the fertilizing process, it’s important to understand the transition phase of a fig tree. This transition phase occurs when you first see the formation of a figlet on your fig tree. The figlet is the small fig that forms between the leaf node and the stem of the tree. This indicates that the tree is transitioning from the growth phase to the fruiting phase. It is at this point that you can start switching to a more aggressive fruiting formula for fertilizing.\nThe timing of this transition phase may vary depending on the climate and the specific variety of fig tree you have. Generally, fig trees start producing figlets about 60 days after they break dormancy. However, this timing can be influenced by factors such as daylight hours, cloudiness, and average temperature. Different varieties of fig trees may also enter the fruiting phase at different times. So keep an eye out for the formation of figlets on your tree to determine when to start the new fertilizing method.\nChoosing the Right Fertilizers\nNow that you understand the importance of timing, let’s discuss the different types of fertilizers you can use to maximize fig production. We will focus on two types: slow-release and soluble fertilizers. Slow-release fertilizers are organic options that feed your soil microbiome. They require the soil bacteria, fungi, and worms to break down the nutrients before they become available to the plants. Soluble fertilizers, on the other hand, are instantly bioavailable and provide nutrients directly to the plants.\nFor slow-release fertilizers, a blend with a ratio of 5-5-5 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) is recommended. However, as long as the numbers are low and relatively close together, a ratio like 4-4-4 or 3-4-2 will also work well. The key is to choose a blend that is low in numbers and in close proximity to each other. A 100% organic source of phosphorus is bone meal, which is derived from ground-up animal bones. This is a great option to supplement the slow-release fertilizers.\nFor soluble fertilizers, there are various options available. These include fish fertilizer, Epsom salt, and Miracle-Gro fertilizers. While some people may have concerns about using chemical fertilizers, it’s important to note that these soluble fertilizers are still derived from natural sources. They have been broken down into their chemical form and are instantly bioavailable for the plants to use.\nFertilizing Method for Fig Trees in Containers\nWhen it comes to fig trees in containers, using soluble fertilizers is essential for optimal production. Containers restrict root growth and lack a diverse native microbiome, making it difficult for the slow-release organic fertilizers to provide enough nutrients. Soluble fertilizers, however, are instantly available and help compensate for the negative environment containers create.\nA recommended soluble fertilizer for container-grown fig trees is Miracle-Gro Bloom Booster. This fertilizer has a high phosphorus content (30%) and is ideal for triggering intense fruiting. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for dilution, which typically involve mixing one-and-a-half tablespoons of the soluble feed with one-and-a-half gallons of water. This gives you a concentration of one tablespoon per gallon, which is the ideal strength for feeding your fig trees in containers.\nFertilizing Method for In-Ground Fig Trees\nFor in-ground fig trees, the use of soluble fertilizers may not be necessary if the tree is well-established and has ample root development. Organic fertilizers, such as slow-release blends and bone meal, can provide enough nutrients for flourishing fig trees. It is recommended to apply the slow-release organic fertilizers in early spring when the tree breaks dormancy and again when the first few figlets form.\nThe application rate for slow-release fertilizers is generally two cups per 25 square feet, which is suitable for a single fig tree. Follow the package instructions for the specific slow-release blend you choose. As for bone meal, it can also be applied according to the instructions on the packaging.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, fertilizing fig trees to maximize production involves timing and the use of the right fertilizers. By switching to a higher phosphorus blend during the fruiting phase and using soluble fertilizers for container-grown trees, you can significantly increase your fig harvest. Slow-release organic fertilizers and bone meal can also be used for in-ground fig trees, particularly if they are well-established. Remember to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for application rates and dilution when using fertilizers. With these techniques, you’ll be well on your way to doubling your fig harvest.
