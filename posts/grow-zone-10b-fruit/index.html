Think again! In this article, we will discuss 13 different fruit trees that you can successfully grow in your zone 10b backyard. From cherimoya to bananas, we will cover a wide variety of trees that will thrive in your specific climate.\n1. Cherry Moya Tree\nLet’s start with the cherry moya tree. This tree is currently growing in a container, and the owner is proud to share that it is producing flowers and fruits for the first time. The tree is still small and has three branches on one side and five on the other. Despite its size, it has already set about eight fruits. It’s amazing to see such success with this tree, considering its humble appearance.\n2. Pomegranate Tree\nNext up is the pomegranate tree. Standing at an impressive 15 feet tall, this tree has been pruned to open up the center and allow airflow. It currently has male flowers, but the owner is eagerly awaiting the arrival of female flowers. While there aren’t many fruits yet, the pomegranate tree is expected to have a bountiful harvest by November or December.\n3. Pear Tree\nThe pear tree is planted alongside a compost area to take advantage of the nutrients that may seep into the soil. Although it hasn’t shown significant growth, it is surviving and not deteriorating. The pear tree has been strategically positioned next to lemongrass, highlighting the owner’s gardening savvy.\n4. Cherry Tree\nMoving on to the cherry tree, this ultra-dwarf compact stella cherry tree is doing well despite not producing any cherries yet. It has experienced a lot of new growth and is currently standing at about five feet tall. With patience and care, cherries are expected in the future.\n5. Fuji Persimmon Tree\nThe fuji persimmon tree is flourishing with an abundant load of persimmons on each branch. The tree is not yet planted in the ground, but it stands tall at about four feet. Unfortunately, it has dropped around 50 fruits due to overcrowding, but the ones remaining promise an excellent harvest.\n6. Pakistan Mulberry Tree\nThe pakistan mulberry tree, known for its aggressive root system, is kept in a pot for control. Although it is still small, the owner is content with its current size and is excited to watch it grow.\n7. Avocado Tree\nThe avocado tree, planted from a store-bought sapling, is showing great progress with plenty of new growth. However, it has not yet produced any flowers or fruit. With time and proper care, avocados may be on the horizon.\n8. Cara Cara Orange Tree\nThe cara cara orange tree, planted about eight to nine years ago, has shown heavy production in the last year. This year’s harvest is not as abundant, but the oranges are described as incredibly delicious. This tree is definitely a must-have for any backyard.\n9. Mango Tree\nThe mango tree is a personal favorite of the owner. Although the variety is unknown, it was purchased from a big box store and is now producing fruits. The mangoes are hanging from the tree, promising a delightful treat in the near future.\n10. Ice Cream Bean Plant\nThe ice cream bean plant, a tropical fruit, is currently in a small pot but will soon be moved to a larger one. The owner purchased it from a nursery specializing in tropical fruits. This small plant has the potential to grow into a majestic tree, providing shade and delectable fruit.\n11. Papaya Tree\nGrowing beautifully at approximately six feet tall, the papaya tree is flowering and displaying signs of growth. Although there are no ripe papayas yet, the blooms are a positive sign for future fruits.\n12. Nectarine Tree\nWhile still ripening, the nectarines on the nectarine tree are turning color with the promise of a delicious harvest. To protect the fruits from pests, the owner has purchased mesh bags.\n13. Banana Tree\nLast but not least, we have the banana tree. Standing tall with its ripe bananas, this tree is a wonderful addition to any backyard. The owner shares a lovely moment on Father’s Day, picking one of the bananas with the help of their partner.\nIn conclusion, growing fruit trees in a zone 10b backyard is very much possible. From cherimoya to bananas, each tree has proven to be successful even with its unique growth requirements. With proper care, patience, and a deep understanding of the specific needs of each tree, you too can enjoy the fruits of your labor. So why wait? Start planting your own fruit trees and enjoy the sweet rewards in no time.\nDon’t forget to comment, like, and subscribe to the P-Tree Gardening Youtube channel for more informative videos like this.
