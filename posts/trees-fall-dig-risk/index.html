This was certainly the case for Mike Smith, an amateur treasure hunter, whose hobby led him to a remarkable find in south Pembrokeshire, Wales. In February 2018, while metal detecting on unexplored farmland, Smith stumbled upon something that would change his life forever. Little did he know, he had found a piece of a Celtic chariot burial, dating back over 2,000 years. This article will delve into the details of this incredible discovery, providing a step-by-step account of Smith’s journey and exploring the significance of the artifacts he uncovered.\nMike Smith’s Journey as a Treasure Hunter Mike Smith’s fascination with metal detecting began at a young age when he received his first metal detector as a Christmas gift from his father in 1977. Growing up in South Pembrokeshire, Wales, Smith spent countless days exploring the countryside in search of hidden treasures. Although he knew that making a career out of his hobby was unlikely, his love for the great outdoors and his unwavering enthusiasm kept him driven in his search for something extraordinary.\nThe Unexpected Discovery On a rainy afternoon in February 2018, Smith decided to take his metal detector out for a spin. Little did he know that this seemingly ordinary day would turn into a historic one. As he made his way across the farmland, he heard the distinct beep of his metal detector, indicating the presence of something buried beneath the ground. Intrigued, Smith decided to dig deeper, hoping to uncover something of value.\nAfter creating a hole about a foot wide and two feet deep, Smith felt something small and metallic. With careful precision, he removed the object from the hole, initially thinking it might be a rusted old coin or a medieval brooch. However, upon closer inspection, he noticed the greenish hue and delicate red engravings decorating the object. As he continued digging, he unearthed more pieces, including a large metal link connected to a rusted chain.\nThe Significance of the Artifacts At this point, the excitement was building, and Smith knew that he had stumbled upon something truly extraordinary. To ensure the proper preservation and analysis of these artifacts, he contacted the Portable Antiquities Scheme in Wales. Subsequently, a trial excavation was conducted, involving expert archaeologists from the National Museum Wales and Dyfed Archaeological Trust.\nDuring the exploration, a total of nine artifact fragments were recovered. Each piece varied in shape and size, with unique decorative markings and engravings. Through a combination of expert knowledge and comparisons to similar artifacts across Britain, the archaeologists determined that the objects dated back to the late Iron Age, around 25 to 75 A.D. This period marked a significant technological advancement with the introduction of ironworking.\nUnveiling a Celtic Chariot Burial As the experts analyzed the artifacts, it became evident that Smith had unearthed the pieces of a Celtic chariot burial. The Celts were early Indo-European people who spread across Europe from the second millennium B.C. to the first century B.C. Chariots held great symbolic and ceremonial importance for the Celts, representing power and tribal identity in Iron Age communities.\nAmong the artifacts discovered, the first object turned out to be part of the bridal harness, while the ring-like object was a large turret ring or rain guide. These pieces were used to guide the lines that run through the hands of the chariot driver, ensuring the horse stayed on track. Other discoveries included parts of a large horse brooch, a harness fitting, and fragments of the bridal bit connected to the chain links.\nUnderstanding the Historical Context The artifacts uncovered in this Celtic chariot burial offer valuable insights into the lives and customs of Iron Age peoples. The decorative markings on the objects, known as Late Celtic or Late La Tène art, were created using red glass and enamel, giving the pieces their distinctive design. Historians believe that these artifacts would have been made between 25 to 75 A.D., representing a pivotal period in Iron Age history.\nDuring this time, the Roman Empire expanded its territories, bringing England and Wales under its rule. Iron Age tribes defended their way of life against this expansion, and these chariot pieces may have witnessed some of these key historical events. The burial of a high-ranking individual with their chariot, horses, tack, and weapons was a common practice during this era, signifying the importance of these artifacts.\nThe Rewards of Discovery For his remarkable find, Mike Smith has the opportunity to receive a significant reward. In January 2019, an inquest declared his discovery as treasure, offering him the possibility of a $1.3 million payout. However, according to the law, this amount must be shared equally with the landowner. Additionally, Smith is required to sell the 34 artifacts to a museum, with the National Museum Wales expressing keen interest in acquiring them for proper conservation. The exact location of the discovery remains a secret, as it holds the potential for further archaeological exploration.\nConclusion Mike Smith’s discovery of a Celtic chariot burial in Wales speaks to the spirit of adventure and curiosity that drives treasure hunters around the world. Through his passion for metal detecting and a stroke of luck, he unearthed artifacts that shed light on a crucial period in Iron Age history. The significance of his find extends beyond its monetary value, offering historians and archaeologists a deeper understanding of Celtic culture and their interactions with the expanding Roman Empire. As we continue to explore the world’s hidden treasures, stories like this remind us of the wonders that lie just beneath the surface, waiting to be discovered.\n","wordCount":"943","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Julie Allen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://plantmegreen.github.io/posts/trees-fall-dig-risk/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Plant me Green","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://plantmegreen.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Plant me Green (Alt + H)"><img src=https://plantmegreen.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Plant me Green</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>CORPSE Found Hidden In Tree Trunk: Unearthing a Celtic Treasure Trove in Wales</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 23, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;943 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Julie Allen</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#mike-smiths-journey-as-a-treasure-hunter>Mike Smith&rsquo;s Journey as a Treasure Hunter</a></li><li><a href=#the-unexpected-discovery>The Unexpected Discovery</a></li><li><a href=#the-significance-of-the-artifacts>The Significance of the Artifacts</a></li><li><a href=#unveiling-a-celtic-chariot-burial>Unveiling a Celtic Chariot Burial</a></li><li><a href=#understanding-the-historical-context>Understanding the Historical Context</a></li><li><a href=#the-rewards-of-discovery>The Rewards of Discovery</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lvwk5doliwU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>Unearthing hidden treasures often requires a combination of persistence, luck, and a passion for discovery.
