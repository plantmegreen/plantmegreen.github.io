Specifically, we will focus on seven fast-producing fruit trees that every Floridian should consider adding to their backyard or small space garden. These fruit trees are not only easy to grow but also yield delicious fruit within a year or two. We will provide detailed information about each tree, including their growing conditions, production timelines, and taste profiles. So, let’s dive in and explore the tropical fruit trees that can thrive in Florida’s unique climate.\n1. The Mulberry Tree\nThe mulberry tree is an absolute must-have for every Floridian. It is known for its rapid fruit production, with the majority of the crop being harvested in the spring. However, some varieties also offer a secondary crop in the fall. The berries, which taste similar to blackberries but slightly less sweet, are incredibly delicious. When grown from seed, mulberry trees may take a bit longer to produce fruit, but if you opt for a two to four-foot tree from a nursery, you can expect to see fruit within the first year or two of planting. One unique aspect of mulberry trees is that their leaves are also edible, adding versatility to this already exceptional fruit tree.\n2. The Banana “Tree”\nThough technically a grass, the banana plant is a popular choice among Florida gardeners. With thousands of different varieties available, you can find a banana plant that suits your needs. Bananas are easy to grow throughout the entire state of Florida and start producing fruit within the first year. Unlike some other fruit trees, bananas are non-seasonal and can bear fruit at any time of the year, depending on the growing conditions. The yield of bananas varies based on the plant’s overall health and happiness. Some growers have reported harvesting over 180 bananas from a single tree, weighing over 21 pounds! However, it is worth noting that banana production can vary, and smaller yields are also common.\n3. The Jamaican Cherry Tree\nThe Jamaican cherry tree is highly underrated but incredibly productive, making it an excellent addition to any Florida garden. These trees can grow to be quite large but can also be pruned to stay small, making them suitable for backyards with limited space. The fruit production is nearly year-round, with a slight slowdown during the coldest winter months. Within the first year of planting, you can start harvesting a handful of fruit every day. The taste of Jamaican cherries resembles jelly and is both sweet and flavorful. However, it is important to note that these cherries do not store well, so they are best enjoyed fresh from the tree.\n4. The Citrus Tree\nFlorida has long been associated with citrus production, and despite some challenges, citrus trees are still a valuable addition to your garden. Due to citrus greening disease, the lifespan of citrus trees has significantly decreased. While they used to produce fruit for 20-40 years, citrus trees now typically yield peak production for only 5-10 years. As a result, many gardeners treat citrus trees as short-lived perennials rather than long-lasting additions to their landscape. Growing citrus trees in pots can help extend their lifespan, allowing them to continue producing fruit even though their longevity has been compromised. The taste of citrus fruit needs no introduction, as lemons and grapefruits are loved by many.\n5. The Jujube Tree (Chinese Date)\nThe jujube tree, also known as the Chinese date, is a lesser-known fruit tree that deserves more attention. This tree starts producing fruit just one year after planting and continues to yield anywhere from 40 to 100 pounds of fruit once it reaches maturity, which typically takes around two years. The fruit, resembling crisp apples, can be enjoyed fresh or allowed to dry on the tree. When dried, they serve as a date alternative for smoothies, baking, and other culinary endeavors. Jujube trees are versatile, compact, and highly productive. However, it is important to be cautious of the thorns on these trees, as they can grab onto unsuspecting passersby.\n6. The Barbados Cherry (Acerola)\nThe Barbados cherry, often referred to as Acerola, is a shrub-like fruit tree that can reach a height of six to eight feet, making it suitable for small spaces. This tree is a powerhouse of vitamins, containing more vitamin C in a single berry than the recommended daily dose. Despite being tart, the cherries are still enjoyable, especially when fully ripened to a vibrant red color. While the production can vary depending on the amount of sunlight the tree receives, it is still worth planting for its nutritional benefits and the pleasure of harvesting your own vitamins.\n7. The Blueberry Bush\nWhile not technically a tree, blueberry bushes are a fantastic addition to any Florida garden. They are easy to grow and offer a relatively short but bountiful season of fruit production, typically spanning from March to May. The delicious taste of blueberries needs no introduction, and within the first year or two of planting, you can expect to harvest two to five pounds of fruit per plant. Blueberry bushes come in early, mid, and late-season varieties, so consider planting a mix to ensure cross-pollination and extend your harvest period. Whether eaten fresh or used in various culinary creations, blueberries are a favorite among both adults and children.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, taking care of trees in the fall season is crucial for maintaining a healthy and productive garden in Florida. By adding these seven fast-producing fruit trees to your garden, you can enjoy the beauty and taste of tropical fruits throughout the year. Whether you choose the mulberry tree for its rapid growth and edible leaves, the banana plant for its versatility, or the jujube tree for its tremendous yields, each tree offers something unique. Additionally, the Jamaican cherry, citrus, Barbados cherry, and blueberry bushes provide further variety and nutritional benefits to your garden. By incorporating these fruit trees into your landscape, you can create a thriving garden that rewards you with delicious and nutritious fruit for years to come.
