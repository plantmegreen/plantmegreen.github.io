In this article, we will explore the history and success of McIntosh Orchard, and delve into their commitment to quality and sustainability. Join us as we uncover the story behind this thriving family-run business.\nFrom Gold Miners to Farmers The McIntosh family first arrived in the Alexandra area during the gold rush of the 1860s. With the prosperity they gained from mining, they were able to purchase a portion of the into station in the 1880s. It was in 1881 that the McIntosh family acquired their own piece of land, starting out as sheep farmers. However, with the availability of water from the Fraser irrigation scheme, the focus shifted to fruit growing. Over the generations, the family expanded into apricots, cherries, peaches, nectarines, and apples. This diverse range of fruit crops thrived in the region’s favorable growing environment.\nA Commitment to Excellence Wayne McIntosh, a fourth-generation manager, has been instrumental in propelling the orchard to new heights. He participated in the Icehouse owned and operated program, which provided invaluable insights and comparisons to other businesses in the industry. This program helped Wayne realize that McIntosh Orchard accounts for approximately five percent of the country’s feature nectarine production. Additionally, McIntosh Orchard has a significant presence in cherry and apple production. Wayne’s objective is to continue growing the business and build upon the foundation laid by previous generations.\nEnsuring a Successful Succession A crucial aspect of any family-run business is the smooth transition from one generation to the next. Historically, many businesses have faced challenges due to a lack of succession planning. Wayne’s parents recognized the importance of addressing this issue and ensured that everything was clearly spelled out, written down, and recorded. Involving third parties in the process helped guarantee that all family members were accounted for and rewarded. This meticulous approach to succession planning has been critical to the continued success of McIntosh Orchard.\nBalancing Farm and Environment McIntosh Orchard’s commitment to environmental sustainability is evident through their recognition in the 2014 Balanced Farm Environment Awards in Otago. This prestigious award offered a snapshot of the orchard’s practices and highlighted the importance of sustainable farming methods. Wayne acknowledges the value of external feedback and the insights obtained through this process. He appreciates the opportunity to receive feedback and suggestions from experts in the field, which would normally cost thousands of dollars. Wayne encourages other farmers to participate in similar awards, as they contribute to the industry’s growth and development.\nStaying Ahead with New Varieties To thrive in the constantly evolving fruit-growing industry, it is essential to stay up-to-date with new varieties. McIntosh Orchard understands the significance of being at the forefront of industry trends. Although not all new varieties may prove successful, it is crucial to explore and capitalize on potential opportunities. McIntosh Orchard actively engages in trials and testing of new varieties, ensuring that they remain competitive in the market. Falling behind in this industry could set a business back by five to seven years, jeopardizing potential profits.\nAssessing New Apricots for Sustainable Production Jill Stanley, accompanied by an assistant from Crop and Food, visits McIntosh Orchard to assess newly developed apricots in Central Otago. This part of the orchard covers approximately 14 hectares and is the main block for apricot production. The orchard is currently transitioning from cherry picking to peach and nectarine harvesting. Cherries occupy about 10 hectares of land, while peaches, nectarines, apples, and apricots make up the remaining 33 hectares. This variety within the orchard’s crops helps ensure multiple income streams and mitigates the risks associated with relying solely on a single fruit variety.\nWater: The Lifeline of Fruit Growing Water plays a crucial role in the success of any fruit-growing venture, especially in a region like Central Otago. For many years, access to water was limited, posing challenges to farmers. However, with the implementation of several irrigation systems, including the Fraser Dam, Conroy’s Dam, and the Insula Irrigation System, water availability has significantly improved. McIntosh Orchard has benefited from these initiatives, receiving a guaranteed water supply that is allocated based on the size of their orchard. Efficient water management is essential not only for fruit growth but also for frost protection. McIntosh Orchard dedicates around 30 hectares of land to over-tree frost protection, ensuring the crops are safeguarded from potential frost damage.\nA Commitment to Beautify McIntosh Orchard takes great pride in their property and strives to create a welcoming atmosphere for visitors. Their efforts have not gone unnoticed, as they were awarded the water award in the Balanced Farm Environmental competition. This accolade recognizes McIntosh Orchard’s commitment to not only growing and selling fruit but also improving and beautifying their surroundings. The addition of the new dam, although currently devoid of extensive planting, showcases their dedication to enhancing the environment.\nConclusion McIntosh Orchard stands as a testament to the value of hard work, dedication, and sustainable farming practices. Their commitment to excellence, succession planning, and environmental stewardship has allowed them to thrive in the fruit-growing industry. As they continue to explore new varieties, manage water resources effectively, and ensure the smooth transition to future generations, McIntosh Orchard remains a staple in the community. With each passing year, their fruits delight both domestic and international markets, enriching the legacy of this exceptional family-run business.\nThis article was written based on the Youtube transcript of the video “McIntosh Family Orchard” by Rural Delivery.\n","wordCount":"916","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-07-28T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-07-28T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Daniel Crane"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://plantmegreen.github.io/posts/shipping-mcintosh-apples/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Plant me Green","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://plantmegreen.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Plant me Green (Alt + H)"><img src=https://plantmegreen.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Plant me Green</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>McIntosh Family Orchard: A Legacy of Quality Summer Fruit</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-07-28 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 28, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;916 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Daniel Crane</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#from-gold-miners-to-farmers>From Gold Miners to Farmers</a></li><li><a href=#a-commitment-to-excellence>A Commitment to Excellence</a></li><li><a href=#ensuring-a-successful-succession>Ensuring a Successful Succession</a></li><li><a href=#balancing-farm-and-environment>Balancing Farm and Environment</a></li><li><a href=#staying-ahead-with-new-varieties>Staying Ahead with New Varieties</a></li><li><a href=#assessing-new-apricots-for-sustainable-production>Assessing New Apricots for Sustainable Production</a></li><li><a href=#water-the-lifeline-of-fruit-growing>Water: The Lifeline of Fruit Growing</a></li><li><a href=#a-commitment-to-beautify>A Commitment to Beautify</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qw0Ve2h_tv8 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>McIntosh Orchard, located near Alexandra, has been a prominent player in the fruit-growing industry for several generations.
