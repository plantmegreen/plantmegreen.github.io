However, many fans have wondered if there is a king and queen peach who rule over the Mushroom Kingdom. In this article, we dive deep into the Mario franchise and explore the history to uncover the truth about Princess Peach’s parents, shedding light on this long-standing mystery.\nThe Games: A Hint to the Past If you’ve played any Mario games before, you probably know that Princess Peach’s parents are not prominent characters in the series. In fact, there is only a single reference to her parents in the entire game franchise. This reference can be found in the very first Mario game, Super Mario Bros for the NES. The game itself doesn’t contain much text, but the game’s manual provides more information.\nAccording to the manual, Princess Peach, known as Princess Toadstool back then, is the daughter of the Mushroom King. This seemed like definitive proof of Princess Peach’s parents’ existence. However, upon further investigation, it was discovered that the mention of the Mushroom King was added by English translators and does not exist in the original Japanese manual.\nA Glimpse into the Toadstool Family Fortunately, there is more evidence to explore beyond the games themselves. Thanks to Twitter user Super Mario Broth, scans of an old, obscure video game guidebook were discovered. This guidebook, called “Certain Victory Technique,” was released in Japan during the 1980s and focused on Super Mario Bros.\nThe guidebook, which takes the form of a comic book, features an illustration of the Toadstool family. This illustration provides the first-ever depiction of King and Queen Toadstool, Princess Peach’s parents. While this book was released in Japan, a similar guidebook called “How to Win Super Mario Bros” was released in the US a few years later. This guidebook also includes an illustration of King and Queen Toadstool, providing further confirmation of their existence.\nUnveiling the Personality of King Toadstool Up until 1990, not much was known about the personalities of King and Queen Toadstool. However, a comic book series called the Nintendo Comics System was published that year, shedding light on the Toadstool royal family. Throughout these comics, King Toadstool is portrayed as a prominent character, while Queen Toadstool is mysteriously absent.\nKing Toadstool’s primary personality trait is revealed in these comics, and it’s not a flattering one. He is depicted as constantly causing trouble and being remarkably unintelligent. In fact, in one chapter of the comics, titled “Da Stupid Bomb,” all of Mario’s friends and family are affected by a gas that turns them stupid. However, King Toadstool remains unaffected because he is already incredibly stupid.\nThe Queen’s Elusive Presence While King Toadstool is prominently featured in the comics, Queen Toadstool only makes a single appearance, albeit indirectly. Princess Peach begins saying the word “bummer” frequently, and it is revealed that she inherited this from her mother, Queen Toadstool. Aside from this mention, Queen Toadstool does not play a significant role in the comics.\nPrincess Peach: The True Ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom According to the comics, Princess Peach takes charge of running the Mushroom Kingdom behind the scenes. She is portrayed as the one responsible for keeping the kingdom running smoothly, while her father, King Toadstool, constantly finds himself in comedic mishaps. This sheds light on why Princess Peach’s parents are not seen in the games – they simply aren’t efficient rulers.\nThe Extended Family In addition to the immediate Toadstool family, there are a few other characters who may be related to Princess Peach. In one episode of the Super Mario Bros Super Show, Princess Peach’s grandmother makes an appearance. Although it is not specified which side of the family she belongs to, she is depicted as intelligent, suggesting a possible connection to Queen Toadstool.\nThere is also a character named Grandma in Super Mario RPG, but she looks markedly different from Princess Peach, making it unlikely that they are blood-related. Nevertheless, anything is possible in the whimsical world of the Mushroom Kingdom.\nConclusion The mystery surrounding Princess Peach’s parents has been largely unraveled through a combination of game manuals, guidebooks, and comics. While Princess Peach’s father, King Toadstool, is depicted as a bumbling and unintelligent character in the comics, her mother, Queen Toadstool, remains elusive and only briefly mentioned. Nevertheless, Princess Peach stands as the true ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, single-handedly managing the kingdom’s affairs behind the scenes. As fans continue to enjoy the adventures of Princess Peach, it’s intriguing to piece together the backstory of this beloved character and her quirky royal family.\nThank you for joining us as we explored the genuine origins of KING Peach.
