In this article, we will discuss the significance of grafting persimmons on American persimmon rootstock, the different varieties of cold-hardy persimmons available, and reputable nurseries where you can find these varieties. Whether you’re a seasoned gardener or just starting out, this guide will provide you with valuable information to help you make informed decisions when it comes to growing persimmon trees.\nGrafting on American Persimmon Rootstock To ensure the optimal growth and health of your persimmon trees, it is recommended to graft them on American persimmon rootstock, specifically the virginiana variety. This rootstock is known for its hardiness and compatibility with various types of persimmons, including Asians, hybrids, and Americans. Lotus rootstock is also an option, but many experts agree that virginiana is the superior choice. Grafting on the right rootstock sets the foundation for successful persimmon cultivation.\nUnderstanding Persimmon Varieties When discussing persimmon varieties, it is essential to consider the rootstock they are grafted on. All persimmon varieties should be grafted on American persimmon rootstock to ensure optimal growth and results. To explore the different varieties available, let’s take a look at some reputable sources and nurseries known for their expertise in persimmon cultivation.\nEngland’s Nursery England’s Nursery is a well-regarded source for persimmons and has a wide selection of cold-hardy varieties. With a focus on persimmons, this nursery offers valuable advice and recommendations based on their own experience. Located in Kentucky, they have firsthand knowledge of the hardiness and performance of various persimmon varieties. England’s Nursery is particularly dedicated to breeding hardy Asian persimmons that are not astringent, making them a fantastic option for growers looking for both flavor and cold tolerance.\nRee’s Nut Trees Another reputable source for persimmons is Ree’s Nut Trees. They offer a great selection of persimmon varieties, including cold-hardy options. While located in a warmer zone 7, Ree’s Nut Trees has expertise in persimmon cultivation and can provide valuable insights into the hardiness of different varieties.\nEdible Landscaping Edible Landscaping is known for their expertise in cultivating fruit trees and provides valuable insights into the hardiness of persimmon varieties. Located in a colder zone 6-7, they prioritize varieties that can withstand harsher temperatures. Edible Landscaping recommends several varieties known for their hardiness, including “Jiro,” “Say Joe,” “Great Wall,” and “Gwangyang.” They also emphasize the significance of considering the hardiness of a variety in relation to your specific climate zone to ensure successful tree growth and survival.\nThe Evolution of Persimmons: American and Asian Varieties Persimmons have an interesting history, with American and Asian varieties having distinct characteristics and origins. American persimmons are native to North America and are known for their hardiness. Asian persimmons, on the other hand, are found primarily in Asia and are often larger and more flavorful, but less cold-hardy than their American counterparts.\nIn recent years, a growing number of breeders and nurseries have been working on developing hybrid persimmons that combine the hardiness of American varieties with the flavor and size of Asian varieties. By crossing American and Asian persimmons, they aim to create hardier Asian persimmons that are non-astringent and can withstand colder climates.\nCold-Hardy Persimmon Varieties Now let’s delve into some specific cold-hardy persimmon varieties that have gained recognition for their ability to thrive in colder zones.\nNikita’s Gift Nikita’s Gift is a popular hybrid persimmon variety known for its cold tolerance, with a recommended hardiness range from zone 5 to 8. This variety combines the best qualities of American and Asian persimmons, making it a great choice for growers in colder climates.\nRosie Anka Another notable hybrid variety is Rosie Anka, which offers good hardiness in zones 6 to 9. This variety has qualities reminiscent of American persimmons and an attractive tree size, making it suitable for various garden sizes.\nOther Cold-Hardy Varieties In addition to the hybrids, there are also several hardy Asian persimmon varieties worth considering. Some recommendations from Edible Landscaping include “Shang,” “Hana Fuyu,” “Miss Kim,” and “Tam Cam.” These varieties are proven to be hardy in colder zones, ensuring successful tree growth and fruit production.\nFactors that Influence Hardiness While the genetics of a persimmon variety play a significant role in determining its hardiness, environmental factors and proper care also affect its ability to withstand cold temperatures. Here are a few factors to consider:\nLocation: Placing persimmon trees in the right spot can make a significant difference in their hardiness. Planting them against a house or wall can provide additional protection from cold winds. Surrounding the tree with stones or using Christmas lights for warmth can also help.\nInsulation: Provide extra insulation during colder months by wrapping the tree in materials such as burlap or using tree wraps specifically designed for protection against the cold. This can help shield the tree from extreme temperatures.\nMicroclimates: Microclimates are small areas within a larger climate zone that have slightly different weather conditions. By carefully selecting the location for your persimmon tree, you can take advantage of microclimates that may offer milder winters or more sheltered conditions.\nConclusion In conclusion, when choosing persimmon varieties, grafting them on American persimmon rootstock is crucial for optimal growth. Reputable nurseries like England’s Nursery and Ree’s Nut Trees offer a wide selection of cold-hardy persimmons. Hybrid varieties like Nikita’s Gift and Rosie Anka combine the best characteristics of American and Asian persimmons, making them excellent choices for colder climates. Additionally, hardy Asian varieties such as “Shang,” “Hana Fuyu,” “Miss Kim,” and “Tam Cam” have proven to withstand colder temperatures. By considering both genetics and environmental factors, you can ensure the success of your cold-hardy persimmon trees. Remember to provide proper care and protection to give your trees the best chance to thrive and produce delicious fruits.\n","wordCount":"967","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Noel Luttrell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://plantmegreen.github.io/posts/hardy-persimmon-trees/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Plant me Green","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://plantmegreen.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Plant me Green (Alt + H)"><img src=https://plantmegreen.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Plant me Green</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Cold Hardy Persimmon Varieties: A Guide to Choosing the Right Rootstock and Varieties</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-08-19 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 19, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;967 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Noel Luttrell</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#grafting-on-american-persimmon-rootstock>Grafting on American Persimmon Rootstock</a></li><li><a href=#understanding-persimmon-varieties>Understanding Persimmon Varieties</a><ul><li><a href=#englands-nursery>England&rsquo;s Nursery</a></li><li><a href=#rees-nut-trees>Ree&rsquo;s Nut Trees</a></li><li><a href=#edible-landscaping>Edible Landscaping</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#the-evolution-of-persimmons-american-and-asian-varieties>The Evolution of Persimmons: American and Asian Varieties</a></li><li><a href=#cold-hardy-persimmon-varieties>Cold-Hardy Persimmon Varieties</a><ul><li><a href=#nikitas-gift>Nikita&rsquo;s Gift</a></li><li><a href=#rosie-anka>Rosie Anka</a></li><li><a href=#other-cold-hardy-varieties>Other Cold-Hardy Varieties</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#factors-that-influence-hardiness>Factors that Influence Hardiness</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_LrXSpjDS6k style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>When it comes to persimmons, it&rsquo;s important to choose the right rootstock and varieties for your specific needs.
