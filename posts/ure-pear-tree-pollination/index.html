Pear trees require cross-pollination, so it is crucial to plant two different varieties to ensure successful fruit production. We will discuss the planting process, including the ideal tree size, depth, and the importance of choosing the right location. Additionally, we will provide insight into the pollination process, tree care, harvesting, and storage techniques. Lastly, weâ€™ll highlight an excellent method for preserving and enjoying the delicious fruits for years to come.\nPlanting Process: To begin, ensure you have two different pear tree varieties for cross-pollination. In neighborhoods with numerous fruit trees, one pear tree may suffice, as cross-pollination is likely to occur naturally. However, in rural settings like ours, where fruit trees are less abundant, planting two pear trees close to each other becomes necessary. The pollination process relies on insects traveling between trees, facilitating fertilization.\nWhen planting a fruit tree, it is recommended to choose a sizeable tree to ensure robust growth. A number five pot, which is commonly used for fruit trees, provides a suitable container size. Container-grown plants offer more flexibility in terms of planting timing compared to bare root plants. When digging the hole, make it approximately twice the size of the pot to allow for proper root spread. If you encounter roots, a shovel with a sawtooth edge can easily cut through them, making the planting process more manageable.\nProper Depth: One common mistake when planting trees is placing them too deep. This issue often arises from improper nursery stock planting. When planting a pear tree, ensure that you can see the transition where the tree starts to widen. Avoid burying the top root surface too far into the ground. It is helpful to step back and view the tree from multiple angles to better assess its height. If necessary, make slight adjustments to achieve the proper depth.\nRoot Bound Trees: Container-grown plants may exhibit some root-bound characteristics, with roots hitting the sides of the pots. However, in those cases, careful measures are required to break free the root system from its bound state. Conversely, trees that are not root bound require gentler handling. Adding all-purpose fertilizer during planting is beneficial, as it releases slowly and nourishes the root ball. Late summer or early fall is an ideal time for tree planting, as the warm soil encourages rapid root growth.\nTree Staking and Mulching: Staking young trees is essential, especially in windy areas. Using stakes and tree wire, secure the trees for approximately a year until they establish strong roots. If the trees grow healthy, gradually loosen or remove the stakes. Applying a 3-inch layer of wood mulch, such as western red cedar, around the trees helps retain moisture. In windy climates, shredded mulch is preferred as it is less likely to blow away. Avoid excessive mulch depth, as it can create a crust that repels water, leading to inadequate moisture absorption.\nTree Guard and Protection: To fully protect the trees during fall and winter, consider using a vinyl tree guard. This guard prevents damage from mice, voles, deer, and sun scald caused by reflection. As winter approaches, attach the tree guard to shield the bark from potential harm. However, for the time being, it is best to leave the guard off until winter preparations commence.\nPear Tree Growth and Harvesting: Pear trees generally reach a height of about 25 feet and have a width between 15 to 20 feet. These medium-sized trees are exceptionally hardy and can withstand dry conditions. After about four to five years, expect your pear tree to yield its first harvest. While the fruits grown in northern regions may be smaller than those found in grocery stores, their flavor more than compensates for their size. It is worth noting that pears often do not ripen fully on the tree, relying on wind to knock them down for subsequent ripening. Harvesting should occur promptly, as pears have a short window of about five to seven days before they begin to rot.\nStoring and Preserving Pears: One excellent method of enjoying pears for years to come is by dehydrating and vacuum-sealing them in jars. Dehydrated pears have an incredibly sweet flavor, making them a healthy and delicious snack alternative to processed sugars. To dehydrate the pears, slice them thinly and remove any added sugar. Although the process may be time-consuming due to their small size, the end result is well worth the effort. Once dehydrated, store the slices in glass jars for long-term freshness.\nIn conclusion, planting pear trees is a rewarding experience that offers years of delicious fruits. By following the proper planting procedures, ensuring cross-pollination, and providing appropriate care, you can enjoy a bountiful harvest. Remember to protect your trees from possible threats and consider dehydrating and vacuum-sealing for long-term storage. Planting pear trees adds beauty, functionality, and a source of healthy food to your garden. So, start planting and look forward to enjoying the fruits of your labor for many years to come!\nInterested in learning more about dehydrating pears?
