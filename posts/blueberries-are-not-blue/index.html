However, sometimes unexpected dietary restrictions can present a challenge, as Randy Felt-Face discovered when his cousin called to discuss her son’s inability to eat blue foods. In this article, we will explore the truth behind the color of blueberries and why they might not actually be as blue as you think.\nThe Curious Case of Brayden Randy’s cousin’s son, Brayden, has a peculiar condition where he cannot consume foods that contain a blue food preservative. This unique restriction has raised eyebrows, as blue is not a common color in natural foodstuffs. In fact, it occurs very rarely in the food we consume on a daily basis.\nUnderstanding the Color of Blueberries Contrary to popular belief, blueberries are not actually blue. The skin of a blueberry is typically a dark purple or indigo color. So why are blueberries called “blueberries” if they aren’t blue? Well, the answer lies in the perception of color.\nPerception of Color When light hits an object, it interacts with the molecules in that object in a way that determines what wavelengths of light are absorbed or reflected. In the case of blueberries, they appear blue to our eyes because they absorb most of the colors in the visible spectrum, except for blue wavelengths, which are reflected back to us.\nThe Role of Anthocyanins The pigment responsible for the color of blueberries is called anthocyanin. Anthocyanins are a group of water-soluble pigments found in many fruits and vegetables. They range in color from red to purple, and in the case of blueberries, they give the fruit its deep purple hue.\nThe Power of Blue Food While blueberries themselves may not be blue, there is no denying the powerful association we have between the color blue and food. Think of popular blue-colored treats like blue slushies or blue raspberry-flavored candies. These vibrant, artificially colored foods appeal to our sense of novelty and often make us crave their unique flavors.\nNatural vs Artificial Blue It is important to distinguish between naturally occurring blue foods and artificially colored blue foods. Natural blue foods are extremely rare, with blueberries being one of the few exceptions. On the other hand, artificial blue foods rely on food dyes and additives to achieve a vibrant blue color.\nThe Uniqueness of Mint Randy draws an interesting analogy between blueberries and mint. While we associate mint with a bright green color, mint itself does not naturally come in that shade. In fact, if you were to grow mint and it turned out blue, something would definitely be amiss. Randy humorously points out that the blue color of mint-flavored foods is reminiscent of Mentos or a 7-Eleven slushy, not the natural hue of the herb.\nThe True Color of Water Another comparison Randy makes is the color of water. While we often associate water with the color blue, it is actually colorless. The only time water appears blue is when there is a large concentration of it in one place, such as an ocean, and there are factors like impurities or light scattering that contribute to the bluish tint.\nConclusion In conclusion, blueberries are not actually blue, but rather a dark purple or indigo color. The perception of blue in blueberries is due to the way light interacts with the fruit’s pigments. Blue foods are rare in nature, with blueberries being one of the exceptions. Artificially colored blue foods, on the other hand, rely on food dyes and additives to achieve their vibrant color.\nSo the next time you enjoy a handful of blueberries, remember that their true color is not blue, but a rich and deep purple. Embrace the natural wonders of these delicious berries and appreciate the unique flavors they bring to your palate.\n","wordCount":"634","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-08-13T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-08-13T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gary Spain"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://plantmegreen.github.io/posts/blueberries-are-not-blue/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Plant me Green","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://plantmegreen.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Plant me Green (Alt + H)"><img src=https://plantmegreen.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Plant me Green</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Are Blueberries Really Blue?
