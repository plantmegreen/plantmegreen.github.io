With the combination of heavy rain and strong winds, many homeowners are left wondering about the safety of their own trees. To provide expert advice on how to assess the risk and prevent tree failures, we turned to Terry Breyer, an arborist with The Davey Tree Expert Company. In this article, we will delve into the valuable insights offered by Terry and discuss crucial steps homeowners can take to ensure the safety of their trees.\nIdentifying Trees at Risk\nOne of the first signs that a tree may be in danger of falling is when it appears dead or has a dead top. Dead trees often have underlying root issues, which can compromise their stability. Terry recommends checking for the presence of mushrooms around the base of the tree during spring or fall, as this can indicate root rot. Furthermore, trees with tight ‘V’ crotches are more prone to failure compared to those with a sturdy ‘U’-shaped crotch.\nImpact of Saturated Soil\nWith the recent abundance of rainfall, it is crucial to understand the potential risks associated with saturated soil. When the soil becomes saturated, it loses its ability to absorb water, leading to a weakened foundation for trees. As a result, the trees become vulnerable to failure, especially during storms or high winds. Terry advises homeowners to be aware of any standing water around their trees for prolonged periods, as this can deprive the roots of oxygen and cause severe damage. Ensuring proper drainage, such as installing French drains, can help divert excess water away from tree roots and mitigate the risk of unstable soil.\nConsidering Wind Resistance\nAnother factor to consider when evaluating tree safety is wind resistance. Homeowners often wonder if thinning out tree branches or making strategic cuts can improve a tree’s ability to withstand strong winds. Terry suggests making the tree’s ‘sail’ smaller by removing some branches instead of creating holes in the canopy. Punching holes in the tree can create a dampening effect, making the tree even more susceptible to branch failures.\nStabilization Techniques: Cables and Rods\nFor larger trees that require additional support, Terry mentions the option of installing cables and rods. These techniques can help reinforce the tree’s structure and reduce the risk of failure. However, Terry notes that this method may not be suitable for all trees, especially if the tree is exceptionally large and cannot be effectively cabled to the ground.\nAssessing Trees in Harsh Environments\nTrees located in harsh environments, such as urban areas with limited root space and surrounded by concrete, may require extra attention. Terry highlights that despite the challenging conditions, some trees can still thrive. It is essential to regularly assess the health and stability of these trees to prevent any potential hazards. Taking a proactive approach by consulting an arborist to evaluate the tree’s condition can provide peace of mind and ensure the well-being of both the tree and the surrounding property.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the safety of trees in our yards is of utmost importance, particularly during periods of heavy rain and strong winds. By being vigilant and proactive, homeowners can significantly reduce the risk of tree failure and prevent potential damage or accidents. We have highlighted key steps discussed by Terry Breyer, an expert arborist, to help homeowners identify trees at risk, understand the impact of saturated soil, consider wind resistance, and explore stabilization techniques when necessary. By implementing these practices and seeking professional guidance when needed, homeowners can ensure the structural integrity and longevity of their beloved trees.\nRemember, maintaining a safe and healthy tree canopy not only protects your property but also contributes to the overall beauty and well-being of the environment. Stay informed, stay proactive, and enjoy the benefits of well-maintained and sturdy trees for years to come.\n","wordCount":"647","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Susan Brunell"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://plantmegreen.github.io/posts/how-to-prevent-trees-from-dropping/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Plant me Green","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://plantmegreen.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Plant me Green (Alt + H)"><img src=https://plantmegreen.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Plant me Green</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://plantmegreen.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Tips to Keep Your Trees from Falling: Ensuring Safety and Preventing Damage</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 23, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;647 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Susan Brunell</div></header><div class=post-content><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wud9WdPQ5Gk style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>In recent weeks, we have witnessed the devastating impact of toppling trees causing severe damage or obstructing roads.
